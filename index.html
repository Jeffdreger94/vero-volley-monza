			<p class="first">Welcome to the Vero Volley Monza fan run website! This website is dedicated to the SuperLega men's volleyball team, Vero Volley Monza, formerly known as Volley Milano. We are a passionate fanbase for the Milan area's largest volleyball club and created this website for fans to have an online platform to come together in support. Here, you will find the club's history with historical league finishes, overviews from our biggest rivals nationally and internationally, a short biography of our most prominent international players to help familiarize local fans with these newcomers, and the current status of all our standings in competitions.</p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<h4>Origins</h4>
			<p>The history of Vero Volley Monza, like many European volleyball teams, is convoluted and could easily be compared to the life cycle of a phoenix: living when they have sponsorship money, dying when that money dries up, and a rebirth when a new sponsor injects needed cashflow. The clubs origin can be traced back to 1973 under Volley Gonzaga after multiple clubs merged, notably Gonzaga (then the current youth champions) and CSI Milano, a blue-blooded former Italian champion. The club officially debuted in the top division in the 1976-77 season and achieved moderate success in the 1980s, notably crowned the <a href="https://www.cev.eu/club/volleyball-cup/men/">CEV Cup</a> champions in 1987.</p>
			<h4>Fininvest Group</h4>
			<p>The following season, Volley Gonzaga finished at the bottom of the standings. Fortunate to be playing in Milan at the time the football club AC Milan was at the peak of its power, the investment group Fininvest bought the team with the idea of creating a multi-sport club competing on multiple fronts, including volleyball, soccer, basketball, baseball, and rugby. The project was ultimately a failure, with only two 2nd place finishes coming in the 1992 and 1993 seasons, a <a href="https://www.cev.eu/club/volleyball-cup/men/">CEV Winner's Cup</a> and two runner-up medals, and two <a href="https://en.volleyballworld.com/volleyball/competitions/club-world-championship-men-2023/">FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship</a> trophies in 1990 and 1992 to show for the investment made by Fininvest Group. The return on investment was not enough for Fininvest Group to continue the endeavour, and in 1995, they decided to pull out of their experiment.</p>
			<h4>Modern Era</h4>
			<p>The club immediately faced financial difficulties, sold its rights to MTA Padua, and was demoted to Serie B2. In 1999, the club separated from Volley Gonzaga and was renamed Volley Milano. The refurbished club gained promotion back to the top division in Italian men's volleyball in the 2000-01 season. Once again, due to financial constrictions, the team was forced to merge with Volley Piacenza until 2008. In 2008, Vero Volley was formed, breaking away from Volley Piacenza.</p>
			<p>Today, Vero Volley Monza is alive and well, with the team in 6th place as of January 10, 2024.</p>

					<h3>Revivre Milano</h3>
                    <p>The crosstown rivals, Vero Volley Monza have battled Revivre Milano since the latter club was formed in the 2014-15 season. They have gone head-to-head in the SuperLega and the Coppa Italia, with spectacular fireworks in nearly every match. Revivre Milano beat Monza 3-0 on the road this season, with the rematch in Rivivre Milano's stadium on February 14.</p>
					<h3>Lube Civitanova</h3>
					<p>Another northern Italian rival, Lube Civitanova, is one of the four powerhouse teams in the SuperLega and often beats Vero Volley Monza out for the top spots in the league - key placements for both prize money and access to elite international competitions. Vero Volley Monza scored a surprising 3-0 victory away from home against Lube this season but was knocked out of the Coppa Italia against them at the end of 2023.</p>

					<h3>Trentino Volley</h3>
                    <p>Founded in 2000, Trentino Volley is another fierce northern rival of Vero Volley Monza. Another powerhouse of Italian volleyball, Vero Volley Monza has struggled for dominance in the region against one of the best men's volleyball clubs in Europe. However, rumours of internal turmoil surround the club, with multiple top athletes refusing to sign for the club in recent years. Despite this, Trentino is currently at the top of the SuperLega standings as of January 14, 2024.</p>
					<h3>Modena Volley</h3>
                    <p>One of the most historically stable teams in all of European volleyball, Modena Volley was founded in 1966 and has been a constant pillar in the top Italian division since 1968. It is the most successful club in Italy, having won the league title 12 times, the Coppa Italia 12 times, and the Champions League 4 times.</p>
                    <p>Post-Covid, the club has steadily declined and is no longer the face of Italian volleyball. They sit 8th in the league as of January 14, 2024. Watch for Vero Volley Monza to try to replace Modena as an icon of the men's game.</p>
